    <h1>HAPPY BIRTHDAY POOOOKS <3</h1>

    <p>many many happy returns of the day puvii, have an amazing amazing year ahead, God bless you. Thanks for being you and existing in this world and just pushing through it all even when it got hard, its not easy to do so, im so glad and proud of you for the same.</br>
        i'm so glad we met and i had reached out to you that very day with the tarot story thing, one of the better or even best decisions of my life, really loved and enjoyed every bit of time we spent together be it in discord jamming to music together subah ke 6 bje tak or just watching movies whenever we could, it was the best.</br>
        i still remember every moment we spent together and everything we talked about, i cherish them so much and not one day passes by when i dont think about them to make myself feel a little better.</br>
        even though we fell out of touch mid november, just know im the happiest person to have you, your biggest supporter be it when u wanna try out that insta girly thing or for anything, ill be there supporting from the crowd always. </br> 
        listening to anything & everything you say, talking to you would make my day so better maybe i didnt express it properly but thanks alot for being here.</br>
        and the least i can do to reciprocate the effort is that i am always here as usual for you, just ring me when needed and ill listen to you and help you out.</br>
        dont worry too much about 12th and stuff, you're doing good hell even great and you'll do great in the exams. Always believe in yourself because i do and many others do too. Youll do great in anything you try and i know youll reach your full potential. Just never give up and stop believing yourself, and when you do so, come up to me so i can help you and be your cheer person.</br>
        Heres's to hoping everything between us is same and our dynamic remains unchanged, and also hoping that we could go back to spending time together when you are done with the exams and stuff.</br>
        you deserve the world and all the happiness it has to offer and dont let anyone tell you otherwise. andd also my apologies for anything i or someone did to hurt you because you dont deserve any of it.<br></br>
        HAPPY BIRTHDAY once again puvii, enjoy it to the fullest. Happy 17 MWAHHH <3
